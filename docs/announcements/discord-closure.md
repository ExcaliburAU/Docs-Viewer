As I am no longer active in modding and have shifted focus to new projects, there was no longer a need to keep the Discord server open.

The mods I created will remain available on Steam and removed on CurseForge.  
You are free to use them as you wish, but please note that no support, updates, or bug fixes will be provided.  
If you want peace of mind, itâ€™s recommended to find an alternative mod.

Thank you to everyone who was part of it.
