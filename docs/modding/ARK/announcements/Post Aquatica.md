# How to Roll Back to the Pre-Aquatica Version:
1. Open Steam and go to your Library.
2. Right-click on ARK: Survival Evolved and select "**Properties**".
3. In the left menu, click on "**Betas**".
4. From the drop-down menu, select:
```
preaquatica - ASE : Pre-Aquatica
```
5. Wait for Steam to download the previous version.
6. Launch the game. Your mods should now work as before!


If you have a dedicated server, use the **-beta preaquatica** parameter on SteamCMD to download the **preaquatica** branch.
