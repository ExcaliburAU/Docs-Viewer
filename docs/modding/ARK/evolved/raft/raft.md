A standalone upgrade of the default raft from Excalibur Utilities. Built for survivors who need more than a floating plank.  
  
Includes faster speed with reverse, sharper turning, higher weight capacity, double structure limit, 35,000 HP with motorboat-level resistance, and metal class so it's ignored by Leeds. Can be picked up via the MU Menu.  
  
Also includes optional fog remover and clear water features.
