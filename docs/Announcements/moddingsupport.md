Hey everyone,

Just a quick update — **we're officially ending modding support** for both:

- 🎮 *ARK: Survival Evolved*
- 🎮 *ARK: Survival Ascended*

---

### ❗ What This Means

- ✅ The mods **will remain available** on both **CurseForge** and **Steam**.
- ❌ However, we will **no longer provide updates or bug fixes**.

---

### 🚀 What’s Next?

We’ve got new projects we’re focusing on, and it’s time for us to move on.

Thank you all so much for the amazing support over the years! 🙏

Stay awesome,  
**ExcaliburAU**
